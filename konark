    <h2>KONARK</h2>
    <blockquote><p class="h2">
       <p>
        The Konark or Konarak Sun temple is dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya,
         and, conceived as a giant stone chariot with 12 wheels, it is the most famous of the few sun temples 
         built in India. It is located about 35 km northeast of the city of Puri on the coastline in the state of Odisha (earlier Orissa).
          It was built c. 1250 CE by King Narasimhadeva I (r. 1238-1264 CE) of the Eastern Ganga dynasty
           (8th century CE - 15th century CE). The temple in its present state was declared by UNESCO a World Heritage Site in 1984 CE.
            Although many portions are now in ruins, what remains of the temple complex continues to draw not only tourists
             but also Hindu pilgrims. Konarak stands as a classic example of Hindu temple architecture, 
             complete with a colossal structure, sculptures and artwork on myriad themes.

        The Eastern Gangas established their kingdom in the Kalinga region in eastern India 
        (present-day Odisha state) at “the beginning of the eighth century CE” (Tripathi, 368),
         though their fortunes rose from the eleventh century CE onwards. The greatest king of this dynasty was Anantavarman Chodaganga 
         (1077 - 1147 CE), who ruled for about 70 years. He was not only a formidable warrior but also a patron of arts,
          and greatly favoured temple building. The great temple of the god Jagannatha at Puri, begun by him,
           'stands as a brilliant monument to the artistic vigour and prosperity of Orissa during his reign' 
           (Majumdar, 377). His successors continued the tradition, with the most notable being Narasimhadeva 
           I who not only completed the construction of the Jagannatha temple but also the temple at Konarak.

        <h3>THE KONARAK TEMPLE TAKES THE FORM OF A COLOSSAL CHARIOT WITH 12 PAIRS OF LAVISHLY-ORNAMENTED WHEELS REPRESENTING THE 12 MONTHS OF THE YEAR.</h3>
       </p><br><br><br><br>
       <p>
        The word 'Konark' is a combination of two Sanskrit words kona (corner or angle) and arka (the sun).
         It thus implies that the main deity was the sun god, and the temple was built in an angular format.
          The temple follows the Kalinga or Orissa style of architecture, which is a subset of the nagara style of Hindu temple
           architecture. The Orissa style is believed to showcase the nagara style in all its purity.
            The nagara was among the three styles of Hindu temple architecture in India and prevailed in northern India,
             while in the south, the dravida style predominated and in central and eastern India, it was the vesara style.
              These styles can be distinguished by how features such as ground plan and elevation were represented visually.
