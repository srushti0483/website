    <h2>JAGANNATH  PURI</h2>
    <blockquote><p class="h2">
        <p>The temple was rebuilt by the Ganga dynasty king Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 12th century CE,
             as suggested by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant Narasimhadeva II.
             Anantavarman was originally a Shaivite, and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the Utkala region 
             (in which the temple is located) in 1112 CE. A 1134â€“1135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple.
              Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.</p><br>
              <p>
                According to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by Anangabhima-deva II:
                 different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.
                This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign
                 of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.[10] The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings,
                  including those of the Ganga dynasty and the Gajapati dynasty.</p><br>
               <p>
                The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath,
                 a form of Vishnu - one of the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism.
                  Puri is in the state of Odisha, on the eastern coast of India. 
                  The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth century onwards,
                   on the site of pre existing temples in the compound but not the main Jagannatha temple, 
                   and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga, the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. </p><br>
                   <p>
                    The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival,
                     in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars.
                      Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath
                       (which gave its name to the English term 'juggernaut') is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every
                        twelve or 19 years by an exact replica.[2] It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.
                         The temple is sacred to all Hindus, and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions.
                          Many great Vaishnava saints, such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya,
                           Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were closely associated with the temple.
                            Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and Adi Shankaracharya established the Govardhan Math,
                             which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to
                              the followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, whose founder, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, 
                              Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.
